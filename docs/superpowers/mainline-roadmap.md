# Cap4k Mainline Roadmap

Date: 2026-04-16

## Purpose

This document records durable redesign status and decisions for `cap4k`.

It replaces the temporary handoff style with a longer-lived repository record for:

- completed mainline slices
- the current next mainline slice
- work that must stay on separate tracks
- bootstrap contract decisions that should not be rediscovered from chat history

## Original Mainline

The original mainline is:

1. reset architecture to a fixed-stage pipeline
2. migrate major capability slices into that pipeline
3. improve design-generator output quality until old template migration becomes practical

## Completed Mainline Slices

### Phase A: Pipeline Architecture Reset

Completed:

- pipeline foundation
- db aggregate minimal
- ir flow
- drawing-board
- DSL consolidation

Status:

- complete

Traceability:

- [pipeline redesign design](specs/2026-04-09-cap4k-pipeline-redesign-design.md)
- [pipeline db aggregate minimal design](specs/2026-04-09-cap4k-pipeline-db-aggregate-minimal-design.md)
- [pipeline ir flow design](specs/2026-04-10-cap4k-pipeline-ir-flow-design.md)
- [pipeline drawing-board design](specs/2026-04-10-cap4k-pipeline-drawing-board-design.md)
- [pipeline DSL consolidation design](specs/2026-04-10-cap4k-pipeline-dsl-consolidation-design.md)

### Phase B: Design Generator Quality Mainline

Completed:

- minimal usable
- type/import resolution
- auto-import
- template helpers
- default value
- `use()` helper
- design template migration / helper adoption
- representative old design template / override migration
- design query-handler family migration
- design client / client_handler family migration
- design validator family migration
- design api_payload migration
- design domain_event / domain_event_handler family migration
- design generator compile-level / integrated verification hardening

Status:

- the original design-generator quality mainline is complete through compile-level / integrated verification hardening
- roadmap completion state follows merged repository history; some linked slice specs may still retain pre-merge draft headers

Traceability:

- [design generator minimal usable design](specs/2026-04-10-cap4k-design-generator-minimal-usable-design.md)
- [design generator type/import resolution design](specs/2026-04-10-cap4k-design-generator-type-import-resolution-design.md)
- [design generator auto-import design](specs/2026-04-11-cap4k-design-generator-auto-import-design.md)
- [design generator template helpers design](specs/2026-04-11-cap4k-design-generator-template-helpers-design.md)
- [design generator default value design](specs/2026-04-12-cap4k-design-generator-default-value-design.md)
- [design generator use helper design](specs/2026-04-12-cap4k-design-generator-use-helper-design.md)
- [design template migration / helper adoption design](specs/2026-04-13-cap4k-design-template-migration-helper-adoption-design.md)
- [representative design template / override migration design](specs/2026-04-14-cap4k-representative-design-template-override-migration-design.md)
- [design query-handler family migration design](specs/2026-04-14-cap4k-design-query-handler-family-migration-design.md)
- [design client family migration design](specs/2026-04-14-cap4k-design-client-family-migration-design.md)
- [design validator family migration design](specs/2026-04-15-cap4k-design-validator-family-migration-design.md)
- [design api payload migration design](specs/2026-04-15-cap4k-design-api-payload-migration-design.md)
- [design domain event family migration design](specs/2026-04-15-cap4k-design-domain-event-family-migration-design.md)
- [design generator compile-level / integrated verification hardening design](specs/2026-04-15-cap4k-design-generator-compile-level-integrated-verification-hardening-design.md)

## Current Mainline Contract

These points remain in force:

- `use()` is design-template-only
- `use()` only accepts explicit FQN strings
- `use()` is only for explicit imports, not type resolution
- `imports()` remains the output path for import lines
- `defaultValue` in render models is Kotlin-ready, not raw source text
- short-name handling remains conservative
- explicit FQN and symbol identity remain the truth source

## Current Next Mainline Slice

The original design-generator quality mainline is now complete through compile-level hardening.

The next explicit framework slice is:

- bootstrap / arch-template migration

Scope:

- introduce bootstrap as a separate framework capability rather than widening design generators
- migrate old arch-template / project bootstrap behavior into the bounded slot-based bootstrap contract
- prove representative bootstrap presets and bounded slot-based file insertion without restoring open architecture-tree mutation

Non-goals:

- do not reopen generator-core architecture
- do not reopen the completed design-generator quality line inside this slice
- do not widen `use()` or other design-template helper boundaries
- do not restore arbitrary insertion into any architecture-tree node
- do not turn support-track real-project findings into default framework rules without explicit approval

## Bootstrap Decision

The bootstrap direction is:

- bootstrap should become a separate framework capability
- the public bootstrap contract should use slot-based extension
- users may add arbitrary numbers of files through bounded slots
- the public contract should not restore arbitrary insertion into any architecture-tree node
- the old `archTemplate` JSON remains migration input or reference material, not the future public runtime contract

## Non-Default Work

The following remain separate from the default mainline path:

- real-project integration boundary work
- project-specific unblock work
- broader bootstrap flexibility beyond slot-based extension

## Support Track Docs

Concrete support-track references:

- [real project local integration](specs/2026-04-09-cap4k-only-danmuku-local-integration-design.md)
- [real project integration boundaries](specs/2026-04-11-cap4k-real-project-integration-boundaries-design.md)
- [project type registry](specs/2026-04-12-cap4k-project-type-registry-design.md)

## Continue Rules

- If the user says only "continue", continue the original mainline.
- Do not default into an integration workaround.
- Do not silently merge bootstrap migration into design-template migration.
- Only promote project-specific patterns into framework contract when explicitly approved.
